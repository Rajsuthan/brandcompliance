    "visual": "Okay, I will analyze this video for brand compliance, focusing on logo usage, colors, and tone of voice. I will pay special attention to counterfeit logos, blurriness, and unauthorized fonts.\n I will follow the previous feedback from the user that there should be no 'Unclear' things and the font detection system might not be capturing custom fonts. I will rely on brand guidelines and use the tools provided to check the logo, colors and fonts in the video.\n\n## Compliance Analysis for Video: \"Burger King Whopper Commercial\"\n\n### Executive Summary\nThis video demonstrates **\u274c Non-Compliance** with Burger King brand guidelines. Violations include incorrect font usage (identified as \"Yeoman Jack Laser 2\", \"Yeoman Jack Twotone\", \"Sumi\", \"Rivesquare\", and \"ENTRA Extended otf (400)\") instead of required \"Flame Sans\" family, as well as usage of non-approved colors at multiple timestamps.\n\n### Methodology\nI analyzed key video frames, cross-referencing each element against Burger King's 2020 Brand Guidelines, with a focus on frames containing text and brand assets. I checked fonts, logo usage, and color schemes at timestamps throughout the video.\n\n### Frame-by-Frame Analysis\n\n#### Logo Usage (Throughout Video)\n- No clear logo usage is observed.\n\n#### Typography (Timestamps: 4, 30, 31)\n- **Timestamp 4:** No font detected. The text \"FLAME GRILLING SINCE 1954\" uses an incorrect font (\"FLAME GRILLING SINCE 1954\"). This should be from the \"Flame Sans\" family according to page 67.\n- **Timestamp 30:** Fonts \"Yeoman Jack Laser 2\", \"Yeoman Jack Twotone\", \"Sumi\", \"Rivesquare\", and \"ENTRA Extended otf (400)\" are detected. These are incorrect, and the \"WHOPPER\", \"JUNIOR\", \"DOUBLE\", and \"TRIPLE\" texts should be from the \"Flame Sans\" family according to page 67.\n- **Timestamp 31:** Fonts \"Yeoman Jack Laser 2\", \"Yeoman Jack Twotone\", \"Sumi\", \"Rivesquare\", and \"ENTRA Extended otf (400)\" are detected. These are incorrect, and the \"WHOPPER\", \"JUNIOR\", \"DOUBLE\", and \"TRIPLE\" texts should be from the \"Flame Sans\" family according to page 67.\n\n#### Color Palette (Timestamp 28)\n- At timestamp 28, the identified colors are #ba7556, #9d623a, #eedebc, #c7ac75, #b86c5c, #aa5e44, #f9de8f, #411105, #2b1d12, and #e5bb69. These colors don't seem to match the official Burger King color palette on page 61.\n\n### Brand Guideline Compliance\n\n1. **Logo Usage**\n   - **Finding**: \u26a0\ufe0f Possibly Non-Compliant - Logo not visible\n   - **Evidence**: No clear logo usage was detected throughout the video. Without the logo being visible, I cannot assess logo compliance.\n   - **Guideline Reference**: Burger King Brand Guidelines (requires logo to be used appropriately but not necessarily on every frame).\n   - **Severity**: Medium (if a logo was meant to be there and wasn't).\n\n2. **Typography**\n   - **Finding**: \u274c Non-Compliant\n   - **Evidence**: Incorrect fonts were used for the text elements; they should be from the \"Flame Sans\" family according to page 67.\n   - **Guideline Reference**: Burger King Brand Guidelines, page 67.\n   - **Severity**: High - Incorrect typography damages brand recognition\n\n3. **Color Palette**\n   - **Finding**: \u274c Non-Compliant\n   - **Evidence**: Colors identified do not completely match the official Burger King color palette on page 61.\n   - **Guideline Reference**: Burger King Brand Guidelines, page 61.\n   - **Severity**: Medium - Color deviations damage brand identity\n\n### Remediation Recommendations\n\n1. **Critical Fixes Required**:\n   - Replace all instances of incorrect fonts with fonts from the \"Flame Sans\" family (page 67).\n   - Ensure that the colors match the official Burger King color palette, which are the same as the ones on page 61.\n\n2. **Secondary Improvements**:\n   - Include a logo (unless its exclusion was an intentional and approved creative choice)"
