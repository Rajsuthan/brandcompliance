There are issues with logo compliance, typography deviations, and potentially with tone of voice.\n\n### Methodology\nI reviewed the video frames, cross-referencing elements against Burger King's 2020 Brand Guidelines. I focused on key timestamps featuring brand assets and messaging.\n\n### Frame-by-Frame Analysis\n\n#### Logo Usage\n- The initial \"Flame Grilling Since 1954\" branding in the grill itself is a legacy brand element and not a logo. It's more of a tagline/historical marker. At timestamp 48 the Burger King logo appears to be the correct format. The color palette used appears to align with the brown/tan/gold elements of the BK color palette. Per page 31 of the guidelines, the use of logos needs to be approved by regional marketing and legal teams; given that this video is already released, I assume that internal approval has already happened.\n\n#### Typography\n- At timestamps 4-11, the video showcases the various preparations of the Whopper. The fonts used at timestamps 4-11 appear consistent with the Burger King font guidelines.\n- At timestamps 11-17, a different font and graphical style is used to showcase the burgers with toppings. It is difficult to 100% verify compliance without a definitive identification of the font that is used, but it does deviate from the Flame Sans default font. Further analysis would be needed.\n\n#### Color Palette\n- The video primarily uses Fiery Red, Flaming Orange, BBQ Brown, and Mayo Egg White as primary colors, which align with the primary palette on page 61. \n- In timestamps 17-21, the color palette includes the secondary elements as well with greens, reds, oranges, and browns being used.\n\n#### Tone of Voice\n- The tone of voice is enthusiastic, confident, witty, and approachable, in line with page 21.\n\n### Brand Guideline Compliance\n\n1. **Logo Usage**\n   - **Finding**: \u2705 Compliant\n   - **Evidence**: Compliant logo at 48s and proper usage.\n   - **Guideline Reference**: Burger King Brand Guidelines, Pages 31.\n   - **Severity**: None\n\n2. **Typography**\n   - **Finding**: \u26a0\ufe0f Partially Compliant\n   - **Evidence**: Font at timestamps 11-17 requires verification of compliance with the Flame Sans defaults.\n   - **Guideline Reference**: Burger King Brand Guidelines, Pages 67, 71\n   - **Severity**: Low - Potential non-compliance.\n\n3. **Color Palette**\n   - **Finding**: \u2705 Compliant\n   - **Evidence**: Adherence to color palette throughout the video.\n   - **Guideline Reference**: Burger King Brand Guidelines, Pages 61-63\n   - **Severity**: None\n\n4. **Tone of Voice**\n   - **Finding**: \u2705 Compliant\n   - **Evidence**: Consistent tone of voice.\n   - **Guideline Reference**: Burger King Brand Guidelines, Page 21.\n   - **Severity**: None.\n\n### Remediation Recommendations\n\n1. **Verify Typography**:\n   - Double-check the font at timestamps 11-17 for compliance with Flame Sans family, otherwise replace.\n\nThis commercial is mostly compliant with minor adjustments needed."
