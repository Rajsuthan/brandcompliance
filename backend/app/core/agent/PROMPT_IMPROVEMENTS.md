# Brand Compliance Prompt Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the brand compliance analysis prompts to make the responses more detailed, accurate, and grounded in facts.

## Overview of Improvements

The improved prompts focus on:

1. **Detailed, fact-based analysis**: Requiring specific measurements, timestamps, and direct references to brand guidelines
2. **Structured methodology**: Providing a clear, step-by-step process for conducting compliance analysis
3. **Specific examples**: Including concrete examples of the level of detail required
4. **Clear output format**: Defining a comprehensive structure for the final report

## Files Added

1. `improved_prompt.py`: Contains an enhanced system prompt template
2. `detailed_report_template.py`: Provides a structured template for the final detailed report
3. `PROMPT_IMPROVEMENTS.md`: This documentation file

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Frontend Prompt Improvements

The frontend prompts in `App.tsx` have been updated to:

- Provide a clear, step-by-step process for the analysis
- Specify exactly what elements to analyze (logo, colors, typography, etc.)
- Require precise documentation of issues with timestamps/coordinates
- Demand factual justification based on specific guideline sections
- Request actionable recommendations with specific corrections

### 2. System Prompt Improvements

The system prompt in `improved_prompt.py` has been enhanced to:

- Define a structured methodology for compliance analysis
- Require specific measurements and direct guideline references
- Provide concrete examples of the level of detail expected
- Establish clear requirements for the final output
- Prohibit vague statements, assumptions, and subjective opinions

### 3. Detailed Report Template Improvements

The detailed report template in `detailed_report_template.py` provides:

- A comprehensive structure for organizing compliance findings
- Specific sections for each element type (logo, colors, typography, etc.)
- Clear formatting for presenting evidence and recommendations
- An example report with the level of detail expected

## Implementation Recommendations

To implement these improvements:

1. Update the frontend prompts in `App.tsx` (already completed)
2. Integrate the improved system prompt in the backend:
   ```python
   from app.core.agent.improved_prompt import get_improved_system_prompt
   
   # Use the improved prompt in the agent initialization
   custom_system_prompt = get_improved_system_prompt(brand_name)
   ```
3. Use the detailed report template for generating the final report:
   ```python
   from app.core.agent.detailed_report_template import get_detailed_report_template
   
   # Get the template
   template = get_detailed_report_template()
   
   # Fill in the template with the analysis results
   detailed_report = template.format(**analysis_results)
   ```

## Expected Outcomes

These improvements should result in:

1. **More accurate analysis**: By requiring specific references to brand guidelines
2. **More detailed reports**: With precise measurements and timestamps
3. **More actionable recommendations**: With specific corrections for each issue
4. **More consistent output**: Following a standardized structure
5. **More factual justifications**: Based on objective evidence rather than assumptions

## Example Comparison

### Before:
```
The logo appears to be non-compliant with brand guidelines. The colors used in the video don't seem to match the brand palette. The typography might not be using the correct fonts.
```

### After:
```
The Nike logo appears at 0:05-0:08 and 0:22-0:25. At 0:05, the logo measures 120x120px (12% of frame height), which violates the minimum size requirement of 150px (15% of frame height) specified on page 12 of the guidelines. The clear space around the logo at 0:22 measures 0.25x the logo height, but guidelines on page 14 require clear space of 0.5x logo height.

The primary blue color used in the header text measures #1A75CF (RGB: 26,117,207), which deviates from the approved Nike blue #0043CE (RGB: 0,67,206) specified on page 23 of the guidelines. This represents a delta-E color difference of 8.7, exceeding the acceptable tolerance of 2.0.

The headline "Just Do It" at 0:15 uses Futura Bold at 36px, which complies with the primary headline font specified on page 31. However, the subheading "Performance Redefined" uses Helvetica Neue Regular at 24px, while guidelines on page 32 specify that all subheadings must use Futura Medium at 22-26px.
```

## Conclusion

These prompt improvements will significantly enhance the quality, accuracy, and usefulness of the brand compliance analysis by ensuring that all assessments are detailed, fact-based, and grounded in specific brand guidelines.
